Until a theme is selected from the “Design” menu, no color options appear in the “Color” drop down and the “Color” field reads “Please select a T-shirt theme”.
For the T-Shirt "Color" menu, after a user selects a theme, only display the color options that match the design selected in the "Design" menu.
If the user selects "Theme - JS Puns" then the color menu should only display "Cornflower Blue," "Dark Slate Grey," and "Gold."
If the user selects "Theme - I ♥ JS" then the color menu should only display "Tomato," "Steel Blue," and "Dim Grey."
When a new theme is selected from the "Design" menu, both the "Color" field and drop down menu is updated.

Make other title field available when other is selected from drop down
